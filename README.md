# Single Nucleotide Variant Caller (SNVC) 

## Installation instructions
### Note: We assume you already have python installed since these installations require python. Please install python on your laptop if you haven't already. 

### Step 1: Clone our github repository and cd into the directory
``` git clone https://github.com/archxta/cse185_project ```
``` cd cse185_project ```

### Step 2: Run our setup script in your terminal
```bash setup.sh```

We have now generated the BAM files with aligned sequenced reads that are sorted and indexed. We will use these BAM files to identify single nucleotide substitutions using our tool, SNVC.
